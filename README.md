## Modularization

A specially created mockup was used to divide the project into modules.
The finished modularization was chosen in the best possible way to simplify teamwork.
It should be possible to work relatively well in parallel on different corners without causing merge
conflicts.

The folder structure of the project was then created accordingly in order to give the project structure.
However, it is expected that the structure will still be modified as experience grows. As a result, the folder structure
no longer corresponds 100% to the initial graphical modularization.

## UnitTesting

In addition, some unit tests have already been created for the PVA 2 to cover some functionalities. In doing so, the
difficulty of testing state hooks was revealed. It is our intention that detailed tests of hooks will be added later in
the project. However, the following image already shows some tests that could be successfully implemented.
